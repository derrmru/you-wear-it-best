This is a hoodie that was lovingly made from reclaimed and recycled llama wool. 

Beautifully restored to it's original hue, and formatted into the glorious hoodie shape that you see before you. 

If you owned this, you would finally be happy and no longer the empty shell of a person that you became when you hit 30. Such wow!
